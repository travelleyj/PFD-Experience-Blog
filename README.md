# PFD-Experience-Blog

## Week 1 (22/10/24)
My team and I met for the first time which allowed us to plan to come up with ideas and areas to attack to help the targeted group of people.
So far what my team has accomplished is that we have sorted out what are OCBC's features and the enhancements that we thought we could implement.

### Problems encountered
Nothing (so far)

### What went right
We thought of ideas that cover the basic criteria of the assignment

### What went wrong
We could not do enough research on OCBC and the app itself as some of us do not have access to an account in OCBC

### What could I have done better
I should have come in more prepared before the meeting. 

### My feelings
Tired and Happy
