# PFD-Experience-Blog

## Week 1 (22/10/23)
My team and I met for the first time which allowed us to plan to come up with ideas and areas to attack to help the targeted group of people.
So far what my team has accomplished is that we have sorted out what are OCBC's features and the enhancements that we thought we could implement.

### Problems encountered
Nothing (so far)

### What went right
We thought of ideas that cover the basic criteria of the assignment

### What went wrong
We could not do enough research on OCBC and the app itself as some of us do not have access to an account in OCBC

### What could I have done better
I should have come in more prepared before the meeting. 

### My feelings
Tired and Happy

### Reflection
This week, my team and I met for the first time to discuss the project and come up with ideas. We started by brainstorming a list of OCBC's features and the enhancements that we could implement. While we were able to think of a number of ideas that cover the basic criteria of the assignment, we were not able to do enough research on OCBC and the app itself, as some of us do not have access to an account in OCBC. This made it difficult to fully understand the needs of the targeted group and to develop ideas that are feasible and impactful.

Despite this challenge, I am pleased with the progress that we made this week. We were able to lay the foundation for the project and establish a clear direction. In the coming weeks, I will focus on doing more research on OCBC and the app itself. I will also work with my team to develop and refine our ideas, and to create a plan for implementing them.

I am excited about the opportunity to work on this project, and I am confident that my team and I will be able to deliver a successful outcome.


## Week 2 (29/10/23)
We got feedback from OCBC after the Q&A session which allowed us to narrow down our focus in our target group.

### What went right
- Our focus has shifted to elderlies who are not able to read or write
- We were asked to focus on the 2nd person Authenticator feature that we brought up to OCBC
- Inception Deck has been completed

### What went wrong
- I have not been up to the task when creating the outline of the project

### What could I have done better 
- Have better communication with the team members
- Contribute more ideas to the group during discussions

### My feelings
Worried and Excited

### Reflection
This week, we received feedback from OCBC after our Q&A session, which allowed us to narrow down our focus on our target group. We shifted our focus to elderlies who are not able to read or write and were asked to focus on the 2nd person Authenticator feature that we brought up. We also completed our Inception Deck.

Firstly, I am pleased with our progress this week. However, there are a few areas where I could have done better. First, I could have contributed more ideas to the group during discussions. I was hesitant to share my ideas because I was worried that they would not be good enough. However, I realized that it is important to share all ideas, even if they are not fully formed. This will help to generate more discussion and creativity within the team.

Second, I could have had better communication with my team members. I was not always clear about my expectations and needs, which led to some confusion and frustration. I will need to be more proactive in communicating with my team members in the future.

Despite these challenges, I am excited about the progress that we are making on this project. I am confident that we can develop a solution that will help elderlies who are not able to read or write to use OCBC's banking services more easily and securely.

My feelings

I am both worried and excited about this project. I am worried about the challenges that we will face, but I am also excited about the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of the elderly who are not able to read or write.

I am confident that we can overcome the challenges that we face and develop a successful solution. I am looking forward to working with my team members to make this project a success.

[Reflection]
Reflecting on our recent team efforts in developing a project for the illiterate elderly, I'm encouraged by the proactive engagement and collaboration displayed by each team member. Our discussions about potential new features and the thorough research conducted individually have fostered a rich environment of ideas and possibilities. However, despite these productive conversations, we have yet to finalize any new features for inclusion in our project. This highlights a need for greater focus on the limitations and specific needs of our target audience, as well as the establishment of clearer goals and more decisive action regarding feature selection. Personally, I'm experiencing a mix of emotions: happiness due to the enthusiastic involvement of the team and anxiety over our indecision and the need to refine our approach. Moving forward, prioritizing the practical constraints and needs of our elderly audience will be crucial in making more definitive and effective decisions about our project's features.

[Reflection]

My role involved developing specific features and updating our Trello board to track our progress. The project's highlight was the excellent team contribution and the noticeable improvement in our communication, which was vital for our collaborative success. However, finding a common time for all team members to work together was a challenge, occasionally hindering our efficiency.

This realization is crucial for me, as better communication not only enhances individual contribution but also strengthens team dynamics. Going forward, I am motivated to refine this skill, ensuring that my contributions are not only task-oriented but also facilitate smoother collaboration and idea exchange within the team.
