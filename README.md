# PFD-Experience-Blog

## Week 1 (22/10/23)
My team and I met for the first time which allowed us to plan to come up with ideas and areas to attack to help the targeted group of people.
So far what my team has accomplished is that we have sorted out what are OCBC's features and the enhancements that we thought we could implement.

### Problems encountered
Nothing (so far)

### What went right
We thought of ideas that cover the basic criteria of the assignment

### What went wrong
We could not do enough research on OCBC and the app itself as some of us do not have access to an account in OCBC

### What could I have done better
I should have come in more prepared before the meeting. 

### My feelings
Tired and Happy

### Reflection
This week, my team and I met for the first time to discuss the project and come up with ideas. We started by brainstorming a list of OCBC's features and the enhancements that we could implement. While we were able to think of a number of ideas that cover the basic criteria of the assignment, we were not able to do enough research on OCBC and the app itself, as some of us do not have access to an account in OCBC. This made it difficult to fully understand the needs of the targeted group and to develop ideas that are feasible and impactful.

Despite this challenge, I am pleased with the progress that we made this week. We were able to lay the foundation for the project and establish a clear direction. In the coming weeks, I will focus on doing more research on OCBC and the app itself. I will also work with my team to develop and refine our ideas, and to create a plan for implementing them.

I am excited about the opportunity to work on this project, and I am confident that my team and I will be able to deliver a successful outcome.


## Week 2 (29/10/23)
We got feedback from OCBC after the Q&A session which allowed us to narrow down our focus in our target group.

### What went right
- Our focus has shifted to elderlies who are not able to read or write
- We were asked to focus on the 2nd person Authenticator feature that we brought up to OCBC
- Inception Deck has been completed

### What went wrong
- I have not been up to the task when creating the outline of the project

### What could I have done better 
- Have better communication with the team members
- Contribute more ideas to the group during discussions

### My feelings
Worried and Excited

### Reflection
This week, we received feedback from OCBC after our Q&A session, which allowed us to narrow down our focus on our target group. We shifted our focus to elderlies who are not able to read or write and were asked to focus on the 2nd person Authenticator feature that we brought up. We also completed our Inception Deck.

Firstly, I am pleased with our progress this week. However, there are a few areas where I could have done better. First, I could have contributed more ideas to the group during discussions. I was hesitant to share my ideas because I was worried that they would not be good enough. However, I realized that it is important to share all ideas, even if they are not fully formed. This will help to generate more discussion and creativity within the team.

Second, I could have had better communication with my team members. I was not always clear about my expectations and needs, which led to some confusion and frustration. I will need to be more proactive in communicating with my team members in the future.

Despite these challenges, I am excited about the progress that we are making on this project. I am confident that we can develop a solution that will help elderlies who are not able to read or write to use OCBC's banking services more easily and securely.

My feelings

I am both worried and excited about this project. I am worried about the challenges that we will face, but I am also excited about the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of the elderly who are not able to read or write.

I am confident that we can overcome the challenges that we face and develop a successful solution. I am looking forward to working with my team members to make this project a success.

- What went wrong: We need to be more focused and have increased efficiency for our project development
- What could have been done better: We could have better communication with one another, for example, update each other more frequently to keep one another on track and updated.
- My feelings: Hopeful, stress, nervous

[Reflection]

Reflecting on our project aimed at assisting illiterate elderly individuals, we've made significant strides, notably in developing a functional SQL database and outlining our website's basic framework. However, challenges in maintaining focus and project efficiency have surfaced, underscoring the need for better communication and structured management. Personally, I find myself oscillating between hopefulness over our progress and a mix of stress and nervousness due to the obstacles encountered and the gravity of our mission. As we proceed, enhancing team communication and focusing on efficient management are imperative, ensuring we remain aligned with our goal of creating an accessible, user-friendly platform for our target audience.

## Week 4 (11/11/2023)
[Group]
Progress:
- Target Audience: Elderly who are illiterate
-  OCBC Features: 2nd Part Guarantor
-  Wireframe of the project has been completed

[Individual]
What went right: We are on schedule with our tasks which means that we have great understanding of our main feature as well as the other basic features of a banking application.
What went wrong: We need to have better communication with each other.
What could be better: Making constant or more frequent updates with one another.
My feelings: Hopeful, satisfied, Anxious

[Reflection]

In our group project aimed at creating a banking application for the illiterate elderly, we've made commendable progress by completing the wireframe and focusing on a key feature, the 2nd Party Guarantor. As a team, we're on track with our tasks, showcasing our strong grasp of both the main and basic features of the application. However, we've recognized a need for improved communication among team members. More consistent and frequent updates could streamline our workflow and enhance our collaborative efforts. On a personal note, I feel a mix of emotions: hopefulness and satisfaction due to our on-schedule progress, coupled with anxiety about the challenges ahead. Enhancing our communication strategy will be crucial in mitigating these concerns and maintaining our project's momentum.
